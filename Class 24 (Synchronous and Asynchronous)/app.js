// Synchronous
// Asynchronous















// Asynchronous

// setInterval
// setTimeout
// fetch
// Promise
// async await
// axios

// They All Work as Asynchronous




























// Synchronous:

// Code execution happens in a sequence, one line at a time.
// Each operation must complete before the next one starts.
// If an operation is slow (e.g., reading a large file), it can block the entire program.









// Asynchronous:

// Operations can happen out of sequence.
// Allows the program to continue executing other code while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.
// Common in operations like I/O (input/output), where waiting for external resources (like a file read or an API call) would otherwise block the program.





























// this question is come in interviews so tell
// JavaScript is an Synchronous language
